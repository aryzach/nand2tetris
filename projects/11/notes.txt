all subroutines xxx() in class Yyy into VM function Yyy.xxx

functions and constructors take k args, methods take k+1 args

in a 'do' jack statement, must 'pop' because the function will return a 'constant 0'

null and false -> constant 0, true -> constant -1

CAN USE:
Math.multiply(), Math.divide() (these are VM functions used when translating jack '*' and '/')
String.new(length), the String.appendChar(nextChar)
Constructors use Memory.alloc(size)

I think I need to add 'this' to SymbolTable for all methods

when setting a field in an instance of a class, 'pop this 2' I think will set the third field of that instance. I'm not sure how to set the statics of a class

I'm not sure if I should create a seperate VM file for each class or just each .jack file
